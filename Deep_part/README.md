# deep learning experiment for the book genre classification project


## Experiments named "text_classifier?.ipynb":
1. train embedding myself, with LSTM
2. use pre trained embedding with LSTM
3. change 2 from sigmoid to tanh (performs not good)
4. add CNN to get spacial structure 

## "img_classifier1.ipynb":
pre trained VGG16 + a simple dence - too slow

## "title_classifier1.ipynb":
trans from text4, to use title data

## result
Deep models did not perform better than MaxEnt in the traditional part. See notebooks for details. More result recording files are in results.zip.
