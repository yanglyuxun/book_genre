# Deep learning part

These experiments were done in Jupyter Notebooks so that the processes are more clear. `text_classifier` means using the text (excerpt or summary), while `img_classifier` uses the cover images, and `title_classifier` uses the title of the books.


## Conclusion
None of these experiments perform better than MaxEnt in the traditional part, although different network structures were tried. This may be due to the small number of data (less than 10000). According to Andrew Ng's theory, deep learning will perform better than traditional models when data size grows, but may not beat traditional models when data size is small.
